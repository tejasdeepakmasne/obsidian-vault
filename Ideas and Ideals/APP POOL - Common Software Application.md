# APP POOL - Common Software application across Distributions

Some packaging formats have some advantages and some others have something else.

###### Three major software formats supported - 
1. The Distro package manager (like pacman dnf and apt).
2. Flatpak with flathub remote added.
3. Appimages (Make a common repo)

## Goals of the project -
- Create a safe and secure repository or a collection of repositories for distribution of Appimages.
- Create a fast and optimised metadata format for system native and appimage packages. - [[A common package manager]]
- Allow the developer to have a say in which format they prefer the package to be distributed and which package formats and version will they provide support for. - [[A common package manager]]
- Allow for setting of sane defaults which become standard practice across the Linux ecosystem.
- Simple and fast GUI optimised for adaptive design and giving enough information.
- Advanced search capabilities and proper descriptions and generic search.
- Easy to add user reviews with helpful indicators like date and version number and packaging format to help developers and other users alike.
- Trying to make it Cross Platform

## How to do it -
1. Learning to make gui desktop applications - (resources needed)
2. Learning how package managers work - [[Package Managers]]
3. How applications under Linux work - [[How Applications Work#Linux]]
4. 

## Further Goals of the project -
[[A common package manager]]

Making a common package manager framework that is extensible and provides a way for devs to easily package their programs and for the end users to have a easy safe and secure method to install their applications.

Making a package manager service which can provide packages for Linux, Windows and Mac OS and other major desktop OS
