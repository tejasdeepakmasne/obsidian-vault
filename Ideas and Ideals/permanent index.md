- [[A common package manager]]

A common agreed upon permanent index which is permanent and records the packages and their versions with a absoute number assigned to the package.

## Initial Idea about how it will work

- Every available package in the soon to end support debian release or the list in the RHEL package manager so their version can be set
- All extra packages missed will be later added
- This list will be available on many mirrors and everyone who builds a package to be distributed can notify the maintainer team so they can add, and the package will be added after they conform to the
- the method of verification need to be agreed upon as having a council to decide will either end up as an elitist council.
- The minimum for a indivisual made package is  that it be supported for atleast 1.5 years and commitment for commercial ones for atleast 5 years.
- the version system can be - 64bitInt.64bitInt.64bitInt
	- the first 64bitInt is the unique id of the package
	- the second 64bitInt is major version number
	- the third 64bitInt is minor version number
