# Universal Secure ID

Tags: #Linux #Software #FOSS

## What do I mean by this
Safe and secure ID with a API so as to store various information similar to google accounts but more secure and FOSS. This is supplemented by a cloud storage platform which is similarly secure and pivate.

## Some features I envision it to have : 
- Backup, Restore and Reset options.
- Ability to easily manually add/block/delete sources.
- having a functional API which can be used by various services to store custom data types.
- having a framework to safely expose information with services with proper consent from the user.
- Ability to create and manage passwords - [[# Financial Sources]]

### How It would work :
==Requires work== 
Some basic ideas which i do not work if they will work- a public and a private ID with information available through identification using a public ID and an API to allow access to information stored in the ID.

## Financial Sources
The ways this FOSS project can be monetised :

### Providing Support:
Support can be provided on Personal and Commercial levels using different pricing models :

##### Personal Level :-
support can be provided on a personal subscription with a nominal amount like $5 a year or $10 a year or can be bundled with [[# cloud platform]]

##### Commercial level :-
different levels of subscription can be used for Commercial level providing many levels of service -
1. providing hosting solutions and support

==If done nothing basic support can be provided through donations on the personal front and a licence on the commercial front - [[software licences]] ==

## Things to learn to make it happen :

2. Learning safe data storage and cryptography - (Resources required)
3. Learning about APIs - (Basics of a program)
4. Learn about Blockchain Technology - [[Cryptography and Blockchain]]
