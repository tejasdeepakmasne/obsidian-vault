1. mapping out the entire organizational structure of haldirams in detail
	- using graphs and then descriptor pages show the structure down to the last role
	- questions to ask :
		- what are the general tasks undertaken by the department / person?
		- What are the key areas of focus of the role/department?
		- What are some of the strategies use for efficient execution of their tasks?
		- What are some of new areas they are currently working upon ?
2. understanding the automation systems and making a report on their working
	- how the machine works
	- tech used
	- research done 

## Approach :

1. top down approach with each department/role being a part of the tree
- know the general departments and start with their heads to understand the underlying structure
- go down the tree and enquire about departments and note down their roles by asking the above questions
